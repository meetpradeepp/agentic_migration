# Feature Planning

This directory contains planning artifacts for new features.

Each feature gets its own subdirectory with:
- `spec.md` - Feature specification
- `implementation_plan.json` - Subtask-based implementation plan
- `build-progress.txt` - Planning session summary
- `context.json` - Task-specific context

Planning artifacts are committed alongside feature implementation to provide historical context and design documentation.
