{
  "task_description": "Build the complete Enterprise Task Manager application from scratch - a React SPA with system views (Dashboard, Calendar, All Tasks), user lists, full CRUD task management, drag-and-drop, inline editing, context-aware creation, advanced filtering/sorting, dark mode, URL routing, and local-first storage",
  "workflow_type": "feature",
  "services_involved": [
    "task-manager"
  ],
  "user_requirements": [
    "Implement Dashboard view with metrics (total tasks, completed, pending, high-priority counts, completion rate)",
    "Implement Monthly Calendar view with date-based task organization and visual indicators",
    "Implement All Tasks view with comprehensive task listing",
    "Support user-created custom lists with full CRUD operations (create, edit, delete, rename)",
    "Implement complete task CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)",
    "Support inline task editing for title, description, priority, tags, and dates",
    "Implement drag-and-drop task reordering within lists",
    "Support context-aware task creation that inherits list/date from current view",
    "Implement advanced filtering: hide completed tasks, filter by priority level, filter by tags, search by title/description",
    "Implement sorting options: due date, priority, creation date, alphabetical by title",
    "Implement dark mode with semantic theming and smooth transitions",
    "Create fully responsive UI that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop",
    "Implement URL-driven routing using react-router-dom for all views and lists",
    "Implement local-first storage using localStorage or IndexedDB for data persistence",
    "Support task properties: title, description, due date, priority (none/low/medium/high), tags, completed status, creation timestamp",
    "Support list properties: name, color/icon, task count, creation timestamp",
    "Implement visual priority indicators (colors/icons) for tasks",
    "Implement tag management with color coding and filtering",
    "Support task assignment to multiple tags",
    "Implement calendar navigation (month/year selection)",
    "Show task counts and completion status on calendar dates",
    "Implement empty states for views with no tasks",
    "Support keyboard shortcuts for common actions",
    "Implement undo/redo functionality for task operations",
    "Support bulk operations (multi-select and batch actions)"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Dashboard displays accurate metrics that update in real-time as tasks change",
    "Calendar view shows tasks organized by due date with correct monthly navigation",
    "All Tasks view displays all tasks with filtering and sorting applied correctly",
    "Users can create, edit, rename, and delete custom lists without errors",
    "Tasks can be created from any view and inherit context (list/date) appropriately",
    "Inline editing saves changes immediately without page refresh",
    "Drag-and-drop reordering persists task order within lists",
    "Filter toggles work correctly: hide completed removes completed tasks, priority filter shows only selected priorities, tag filter shows only tasks with selected tags",
    "Search filters tasks in real-time as user types",
    "Sorting changes task order based on selected criteria (due date, priority, etc.)",
    "Dark mode toggle switches theme across entire application with smooth transition",
    "UI is fully responsive and usable on screens from 320px to 4K resolution",
    "URL changes when navigating between views and lists (bookmarkable URLs)",
    "Browser back/forward buttons work correctly with routing",
    "All data persists across page refreshes via localStorage/IndexedDB",
    "Task priority levels are visually distinct (color-coded or icon-based)",
    "Tags are displayed with colors and can be filtered",
    "Calendar dates show task counts and visual completion indicators",
    "Empty states display helpful messages when no tasks/lists exist",
    "Application loads within 2 seconds on typical broadband connection",
    "No console errors during normal usage",
    "All CRUD operations complete successfully without data loss",
    "Theme preference persists across sessions",
    "Task and list data structure supports all required properties"
  ],
  "edge_cases": [
    "Creating a task without a due date (should allow undefined/null dates)",
    "Creating a task in calendar view for a past date (should allow historical tasks)",
    "Deleting a list that contains tasks (should handle task reassignment or deletion)",
    "Filtering with no matching results (should show empty state)",
    "Searching with special characters or regex patterns (should handle safely)",
    "Dragging tasks between different lists (should update list assignment)",
    "Editing a task while filters are active (should maintain filter state)",
    "Switching themes while modals/dropdowns are open (should update all UI elements)",
    "Maximum task title/description length (should truncate or validate)",
    "Very long list names (should truncate in sidebar)",
    "Many tags on a single task (should handle overflow)",
    "Calendar navigation to far future/past years (should handle date range limits)",
    "LocalStorage quota exceeded (should handle gracefully with error message)",
    "Corrupted localStorage data (should recover or reset to default state)",
    "Concurrent editing in multiple tabs (should sync or show conflict warning)",
    "Browser without localStorage support (should provide fallback or warning)",
    "Creating hundreds of tasks (should maintain performance)",
    "Rapid filter/sort toggling (should debounce and handle state correctly)",
    "Incomplete task data from localStorage (should validate and fix)",
    "Deleting the currently viewed list (should redirect to safe view)"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must be a single-page React application (SPA)",
    "Must use react-router-dom for URL routing",
    "Must use localStorage or IndexedDB for persistence (no backend/API required)",
    "Must support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)",
    "Must be mobile-first responsive design",
    "Must not require external API calls or third-party services for core functionality",
    "Must maintain under 500KB initial bundle size (excluding node_modules)",
    "Must load and render initial view within 2 seconds on 3G connection",
    "Must work offline after initial load (PWA-like behavior)",
    "Must handle at least 1000 tasks without performance degradation",
    "Dark mode must have proper contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA)",
    "Must support keyboard navigation for accessibility",
    "Must not lose data on page refresh or browser close",
    "Must use semantic HTML for accessibility",
    "Must not expose sensitive data in localStorage (though no sensitive data expected)"
