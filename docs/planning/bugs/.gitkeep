# Bug Fix Planning

This directory contains planning artifacts for bug fixes and investigations.

Each bug fix gets its own subdirectory with:
- `spec.md` - Bug description and reproduction steps
- `implementation_plan.json` - Investigation + fix workflow
- `root-cause.md` - Root cause analysis
- `build-progress.txt` - Planning session summary

Root cause documentation is especially important for preventing similar issues in the future.
