# Project-level Strategic Roadmaps

This directory contains project-level strategic planning artifacts generated by the roadmap agents.

## Expected Files

- `roadmap_discovery.json` - Discovery Agent output (project analysis, audience, competitive context)
- `roadmap.json` - Features Agent output (prioritized feature roadmap with 15-25 features)
- `ROADMAP.md` - Executive summary (optional, human-generated or agent-generated)
- `ROADMAP_GUIDE.md` - Navigation guide (optional)
- `competitor_analysis.json` - Competitor analysis (optional input for Features Agent)

## Workflow

1. **Discovery Agent** → `roadmap_discovery.json`
2. **Features Agent** (uses discovery.json) → `roadmap.json`
3. **Planner Agent** (uses specific feature from roadmap.json) → Creates feature-level plan in `docs/planning/features/[feature-slug]/`

See `.github/instructions/orchestrator.instructions.md` for the complete workflow.
