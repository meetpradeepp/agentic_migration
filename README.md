# Agentic Migration

An experimental project to explore and test GitHub Copilot's capabilities in agentic workflows and migration tasks.

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Team Members

**New to this project?** Start here:
- **[Onboarding Guide](docs/onboarding/README.md)** - Comprehensive introduction to the agentic workflow system
- **[Quick Reference](docs/onboarding/quick-reference.md)** - Command cheat sheet and common patterns

**Want to understand how it works in 5 minutes?**
1. Read the [Core Concepts](docs/onboarding/README.md#core-concepts-5-minute-understanding) section
2. Try: `@orchestrator "analyze this project"`
3. Review the output and observe how agents coordinate

## Overview

This repository implements an **agentic workflow system** that breaks down complex software development tasks into manageable phases using specialized AI agents. Each agent has a specific role (discovery, planning, research, specification, coding, validation) and communicates through structured JSON files.

**Key Innovation**: Architectural decisions are documented and approved BEFORE implementation begins, preventing costly rewrites through the ADR (Architecture Decision Record) approval gate pattern.

### How It Works

```
User Request → Discovery → Planning → Research → 
ADR Generation → ⏸️ APPROVAL GATE ⏸️ → Specification → 
Implementation → Validation → Done
```

**What makes this different?**
- Agents coordinate autonomously (orchestrator manages workflow)
- Architectural decisions require explicit approval (ADR gates)
- Quality is validated automatically (QA agent runs tests)
- Context is preserved (JSON handoffs between agents)

## Purpose

The key objectives of this project are to:

- **Test Agentic Workflows**: Evaluate Copilot's ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously
- **Explore Migration Capabilities**: Assess how effectively Copilot can assist with code migrations and refactoring
- **Document Learnings**: Capture insights, best practices, and limitations discovered during experimentation
- **Optimize Prompting Strategies**: Develop effective ways to guide Copilot for better results
- **Establish Patterns**: Identify reusable patterns for working with AI coding assistants

#### Planning Artifacts

## Documentation Philosophy

This project treats **planning artifacts as first-class documentation** that travels with the code. Unlike traditional approaches where plans are discarded after implementation, we commit planning sessions to provide:

### Why Commit Planning Artifacts?

1. **Historical Context** - Future developers understand WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was built
2. **Design Documentation** - `implementation_plan.json` serves as living architecture documentation
3. **Root Cause Preservation** - Investigation workflows document the "why" behind bugs
4. **Code Review Enhancement** - Reviewers can see the plan alongside implementation
5. **Knowledge Transfer** - Onboarding shows how features evolved from plan to code
6. **Audit Trail** - Track decision-making process over time

### Documentation Structure

All documentation lives in the `docs/` directory, organized by purpose:

- **`docs/planning/`** - Planning sessions for features, bugs, and investigations (committed)
- **`docs/adr/`** - Architecture Decision Records
- **`docs/knowledge-base/`** - Team learnings, patterns, and guides
- **`docs/architecture/`** - System architecture and component documentation
Agent Skills Framework**: Self-contained, reusable capabilities inspired by [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
  - Progressive loading (metadata → instructions → resources)
  - Bundled resources (scripts, templates, references, assets)
  - Portable across projects and agents
  - Auto-discovery via keyword matching
- **Planner Agent System**: Autonomous planning agent for complex workflows
  - Uses subtask-planning skill for plan generation
See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for detailed structure and guidelines.

## Agent System

This project implements an agentic workflow system based on the Auto-Claude architecture:

### Orchestrator Agent

The **Orchestrator Agent** coordinates multi-agent workflows for comprehensive planning:

- **Role**: Manages agent sequencing, data handoffs, and user feedback loops
- **Supported Workflows**:
  1. **Complete Roadmap Generation**: Discovery → Features → Implementation
  2. **Discovery Only**: Standalone project analysis
  3. **Features from Discovery**: Generate roadmap from existing discovery
  4. **Implementation Planning**: Create execution plans from roadmap
  5. **Direct Planning**: Skip roadmap, plan specific features
- **Key Features**:
  - **Workflow Detection**: Analyzes requests to determine appropriate agent sequence
  - **Data Validation**: Ensures outputs match schemas and prerequisites exist
  - **User Gates**: Requests approval before major transitions
  - **Error Handling**: Provides actionable guidance when issues occur
  - **State Tracking**: Maintains progress visibility throughout workflows

**Usage Example**:
```
User: "Create a complete roadmap for this project"

Orchestrator:
1. Runs Discovery Agent → roadmap_discovery.json
2. Shows findings, awaits approval
3. Runs Features Agent → roadmap.json
4. Shows roadmap, awaits approval
5. Offers to plan specific features
```

**See**: [Orchestrator Usage Guide](docs/orchestrator-usage.md) for detailed workflows and examples.

### Planner Agent

The **Planner Agent** is the first agent in the autonomous development workflow:

- **Role**: Creates subtask-based implementation plans without implementing code
- **Input**: `spec.md` file with task requirements
- **Output**: 
  - `implementation_plan.json` - Structured plan with phases and subtasks
  - `init.sh` - Environment setup script
  - `build-progress.txt` - Planning session summary
- **Key Features**:
  - Mandatory codebase investigation before planning
  - Workflow type classification (feature/refactor/investigation/migration/simple)
  - Dependency management and parallelization analysis
  - Per-subtask verification requirements

### Roadmap Discovery Agent

The **Roadmap Discovery Agent** performs autonomous project analysis for strategic planning:

- **Role**: Understands project purpose, audience, and competitive positioning
- **Input**: `project_index.json` (project structure)
- **Output**: `roadmap_discovery.json` - Complete project profile
- **Key Features**:
  - **Non-interactive**: No user questions, inference-based analysis
  - **Autonomous Discovery**: Purpose, target audience, pain points
  - **Maturity Assessment**: Idea → Prototype → MVP → Growth → Mature
  - **Competitive Context**: Alternatives, differentiators, market position
  - **Constraint Identification**: Technical, resource, dependency limits

### Roadmap Features Agent

The **Roadmap Features Agent** generates strategic product roadmaps from discovery data:

- **Role**: Creates prioritized features organized into execution phases
- **Input**:
  - `roadmap_discovery.json` (project understanding)
  - `project_index.json` (codebase structure)
  - `competitor_analysis.json` (optional - competitor insights)
- **Output**: `roadmap.json` - Complete roadmap with features, phases, milestones
- **Key Features**:
  - **MoSCoW Prioritization**: Must/Should/Could/Won't framework
  - **Priority Matrix**: Impact vs Complexity assessment (Quick Wins, Big Bets, Fill-ins, Time Sinks)
  - **Phase Organization**: Foundation → Enhancement → Scale → Future
  - **Dependency Mapping**: Feature relationships and execution order
  - **Milestone Creation**: Demonstrable, testable, valuable checkpoints
  - **Competitor Integration**: Links features to competitor pain points

### Workflow Types

| Type | Use Case | Phase Structure |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **FEATURE** | Multi-service development | Backend → Worker → Frontend → Integration |
| **REFACTOR** | Code restructuring | Add New → Migrate → Remove Old → Cleanup |
| **INVESTIGATION** | Bug analysis | Reproduce → Investigate → Fix → Harden |
| **MIGRATION** | Data/system migration | Prepare → Test → Execute → Cleanup |
| **SIMPLE** | Single-service changes | Implementation (single phase) |
