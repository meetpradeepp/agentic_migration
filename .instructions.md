# AI Instructions

This project uses structured instruction files to guide GitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants.

## Main Instructions

See **[.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)** for project-wide guidelines covering:
- Code style and standards
- Testing and security practices
- Workflow preferences
- Tool and framework preferences

## Detailed Instructions by Topic

Additional specialized instructions are organized in `.github/instructions/`:

- **Planner Agent**: [.github/instructions/planner.instructions.md](.github/instructions/planner.instructions.md)
  - Guidelines for creating implementation plans
  - Subtask decomposition and workflow types
  - Verification requirements and dependency management
  
- **README Generation**: [.github/instructions/README.instructions.md](.github/instructions/README.instructions.md)
  - Guidelines for creating and maintaining comprehensive README files
  - Required sections and formatting standards
  - Content principles and audience considerations

- **Agent Skills**: [.github/instructions/agent-skills.instructions.md](.github/instructions/agent-skills.instructions.md)
  - Framework for creating reusable agent skills
  - Skill structure, metadata, and bundled resources
  - Progressive loading and validation guidelines

## Agent Definitions

Agent definitions and prompt templates are in `.github/agents/` and `.github/prompts/`:

- **Planner Agent**: [.github/agents/planner.agent.md](.github/agents/planner.agent.md)
  - Agent capabilities and constraints
  - Input/output specifications
  - Workflow phases and integration points

- **Roadmap Discovery Agent**: [.github/agents/roadmap-discovery.agent.md](.github/agents/roadmap-discovery.agent.md)
  - Autonomous project analysis and understanding
  - Non-interactive discovery execution
  - Project profiling and competitive positioning

- **Planner Prompt**: [.github/prompts/planner.prompt.md](.github/prompts/planner.prompt.md)
  - Complete prompt template for planner agent
  - Phase-by-phase execution guide
  - Examples and best practices

- **Roadmap Discovery Prompt**: [.github/prompts/roadmap_discovery.md](.github/prompts/roadmap_discovery.md)
  - Template for autonomous project discovery
  - Inference guidelines and bash commands
  - Output validation and error recovery

## Agent Skills

Agent skills are self-contained capabilities that agents can use:

- **Subtask Planning**: [.github/skills/subtask-planning/SKILL.md](.github/skills/subtask-planning/SKILL.md)
  - Generates detailed implementation plans with subtasks and dependencies
  - Supports multiple workflow types (FEATURE, REFACTOR, INVESTIGATION, MIGRATION, SIMPLE)
  - Includes bundled references and examples

- **Project Discovery**: [.github/skills/project-discovery/SKILL.md](.github/skills/project-discovery/SKILL.md)
  - Autonomous analysis of project purpose, audience, and state
  - Non-interactive inference from code and documentation
  - Competitive context and constraint identification
  - Includes maturity assessment and inference patterns

## Adding New Instructions

When adding new instruction files:

1. Create them in `.github/instructions/` using the naming pattern: `<topic>.instructions.md`
2. Update this file to reference the new instructions
3. Follow the structure and style of existing instruction files
4. Be specific and actionable in your guidelines

## File Discovery

**Note**: Root-level instruction files (like this one) are discovered most reliably by AI tools. This file serves as a pointer to ensure all instruction files in `.github/` are properly referenced and discoverable.
