## Agent Skills

Agent skills are self-contained capabilities that agents can use:

- **Subtask Planning**: [.github/skills/subtask-planning/SKILL.md](.github/skills/subtask-planning/SKILL.md)
  - Generates detailed implementation plans with subtasks and dependencies
  - Supports multiple workflow types (FEATURE, REFACTOR, INVESTIGATION, MIGRATION, SIMPLE)
  - Includes bundled references and examples

- **Project Discovery**: [.github/skills/project-discovery/SKILL.md](.github/skills/project-discovery/SKILL.md)
  - Autonomous analysis of project purpose, audience, and state
  - Non-interactive inference from code and documentation
  - Competitive context and constraint identification
  - Includes maturity assessment and inference patterns

- **Feature Planning**: [.github/skills/feature-planning/SKILL.md](.github/skills/feature-planning/SKILL.md)
  - Strategic roadmap generation with MoSCoW prioritization
  - Impact vs complexity assessment (priority matrix)
  - Feature organization into execution phases
  - Includes prioritization guides and feature templates

## Adding New Instructions

When adding new instruction files:

1. Create them in `.github/instructions/` using the naming pattern: `<topic>.instructions.md`
2. Update this file to reference the new instructions
3. Follow the structure and style of existing instruction files
4. Be specific and actionable in your guidelines

## File Discovery

**Note**: Root-level instruction files (like this one) are discovered most reliably by AI tools. This file serves as a pointer to ensure all instruction files in `.github/` are properly referenced and discoverable.
